1.	Oppen my project folder on Visual Studion

2.	Download the latest changes from GitHub
    git pull origin main

3.	Modify locally my files 
Edit, create or delete files as needed … this happens locally

4.	Check for local changes 
When I am done editing locally, I check local changes
    git status
This shows me what has changed 

5.	Stage the files to commits 
    Git add .
Or 
    Git add modified_file_name
Adds all modified files to the staging area (so Git knows I want to save them).

6.	Commit the Changes
    git commit -m "Describe_what_I_changed"
Takes a snapshot of I change — it's saved locally (not yet on GitHub).

7.	Push to GitHub
    git push origin main

Sends my local commits to the remote repo on GitHub.
